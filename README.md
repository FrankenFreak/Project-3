Assignment Summary:

1. Validate the uniformity of numbers generated using numpy.random.uniform() through visualisation
2. Generate random points in 3D space, assess their distribution, and compare it with the spectral issues from a provided script
3. Develop a random number generator to sample points distributed according to P(x) = exp(-x/λ),where λ is the mean free path
4. Visualise and validate results using histograms and linear fits
5. Write a function to generate isotropic unit vectors uniformly distributed over a sphere and combine this with exponential distribution sampling to simulate isotropic steps with exponential length distribution
6. Simulate neutron random walks through slabs of water, lead, and graphite
7. Compute rates for absorption, reflection and transmission for slabs of various thicknesses
8. Plot the variation in transmission, reflection, and absorption rates as a function of slab thickness for each material
9. Determine the characteristic attenuation length with errors for each material based on transmission data
